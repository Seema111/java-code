Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java learning repository! This document provides an overview of my progress in learning Java, including the concepts, projects, and resources I've explored. Feel free to explore and follow along!


Introduction

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for building applications across different platforms. This repository contains my learning notes, examples, and projects as I progress through understanding Java.
Setup Instructions

To start working with Java, follow these steps:

    Install the JDK (Java Development Kit):
        Download and install the JDK from the Oracle JDK Downloads page or use OpenJDK.

    Set up an IDE:
        Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
        Install the IDE and configure it to use the JDK.

    Verify Installation:
        Open a terminal or command prompt.
        Run java -version and javac -version to check if Java is installed correctly.
